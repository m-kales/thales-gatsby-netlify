The actual number of seeds was 6698 and the average guess was a highly respectable 7090.

We will conduct the experiment again next year as always as a fun and inclusive Thales Day ritual that is both scientific and encouraging of philosophical reflection. Please like our [Facebook page](https://m.facebook.com/traditionofphilosophyandscience/) in support of Thales Day and send an email to Thalesday@outlook.dk or via the contact form below to be among the first invited to next year's Thales Day celebration with our top class speakers before tickets sell out.
