Like us, A Posteriori Coffee Co. believe that if more people were exposed to the joys of philosophy the world would be a better place. For that reason, every purchase you make with A Posteriori Coffee helps fund great organizations and educational programs dedicated to doing just that; exposing more people to philosophy and critical thinking. On top of that, their coffee is so good it simply must be experienced. So head on over to [their site](https://aposterioricoffee.com/), and remember to check out their special Thales Day sale on the 28th of May. You wonâ€™t get through Hegel without a good cup of coffee.

Oh, and don't forget [your very own Thales Day mug](https://www.thalesday.com/info). The only mug suitable for enjoying quality coffee and questioning the nature of reality at the same time.
