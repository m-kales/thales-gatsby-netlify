        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

testimonials:
  - author: Peter Singer
    quote: ”Today, more than ever, when popularists are appealing to our baser
      emotions with distorted pictures of reality, we need to celebrate the
      ideals of science and philosophy and protect the free exchange of ideas in
      a calm and civil fashion. I welcome Thales Day as an occasion for
      remembering the importance of these ideas.”
  - author: John B. Goodenough
    quote: “I applaud your endeavor to establish Thales Day on the calendar at a
      time when language is used more often for propaganda than as a medium for
      the pursuit of truth.     Stories, ritual, and celebrations are a way of
      communicating knowing and of sharing a common culture just as the
      sacrament of touch communicates love in a different way than words.
      However, Mythos is a story that bounds our knowledge and is haunted by its
      temptation to believe it to be objective fact; this belief enables the
      powerful to control and exploit a neighbor. Logos knowledge is derived
      from the process of dialogue with Nature, with Mythos, and with Adversary.
      Dialogue has no bounds; it allows continued testing and modification of
      belief in our quest for the discovery of truth and of reconciliation with
      all people.

        21st century, Steven Hawking. He reminds us to, "Look up at the stars
        and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder
        about what makes the universe exist. Be curious." '
