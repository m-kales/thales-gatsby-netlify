  description: in celebrating Thales Day on May 28, the day of the Eclipse of
    Thales and the day most commonly associated with the beginning of rational
    inquiry into nature. With an outset in the intellectual foundation upon
    which our modern world is built Thales Day aims to encapsulate and inspire
    our pursuit of human flourishing and our continued quest for shared
    principles that enable constructive dialogue and mutual understanding.
description: "is rooted in the tradition of philosophy and science that began
  with Greek thinker Thales of Miletus who initiated a shift in thinking from
  mythos to logos with his theory that everything originates from water, and who
  according to tradition predicted a total solar eclipse that ended a war
  because everyone thought that the Gods were angry. "

        ”Today, more than ever, when popularists are appealing to our baser
        emotions with distorted pictures of reality, we need to celebrate the
        ideals of science and philosophy and protect the free exchange of ideas
        in a calm and civil fashion. I welcome Thales Day as an occasion for
        remembering the importance of these ideas.”

    May 28, 585 BC is the day most commonly associated with the beginning of
    rational inquiry into nature. Therefore it is also relevant that we
    celebrate it just like we celebrate other important cultural landmarks with
    reference to the stories told about their origin, such as Christmas.
