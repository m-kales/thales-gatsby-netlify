  title: Our ability to reason
  description: "is rooted in the tradition of philosophy and science that began
    with Greek thinker Thales of Miletus who initiated a shift in thinking from
    mythos to logos with his theory that everything originates from water, and
    who according to tradition predicted a total solar eclipse that ended a war
    because everyone thought that the Gods were angry. "
description: in celebrating Thales Day on May 28, the day of the Eclipse of
  Thales and the day most commonly associated with the beginning of rational
  inquiry into nature. With an outset in the intellectual foundation upon which
  our modern world is built Thales Day aims to encapsulate and inspire our
  pursuit of human flourishing and our continued quest for shared principles
  that enable constructive dialogue and mutual understanding.

        > ”Today, more than ever, when popularists are appealing to our baser
        emotions with distorted pictures of reality, we need to celebrate the
        ideals of science and philosophy and protect the free exchange of ideas
        in a calm and civil fashion. I welcome Thales Day as an occasion for
        remembering the importance of these ideas.” - Peter Singer

        “I applaud your endeavor to establish Thales Day on the calendar at a
        time when language is used more often for propaganda than as a medium
        for the pursuit of truth. 
           Stories, ritual, and celebrations are a way of communicating knowing and of sharing a common culture just as the sacrament of touch communicates love in a different way than words. However, Mythos is a story that bounds our knowledge and is haunted by its temptation to believe it to be objective fact; this belief enables the powerful to control and exploit a neighbor. Logos knowledge is derived from the process of dialogue with Nature, with Mythos, and with Adversary. Dialogue has no bounds; it allows continued testing and modification of belief in our quest for the discovery of truth and of reconciliation with all people.

        Yours Sincerely,


        John B. Goodenough”
