  description: in celebrating Thales Day on May 28, the day of the Eclipse of
    Thales and the day most commonly associated with the beginning of rational
    inquiry into nature. With an outset in the intellectual foundation upon
    which our modern world is built Thales Day aims to encapsulate and inspire
    our pursuit of human flourishing and our continued quest for shared
    principles that enable constructive dialogue and mutual understanding.
description: "is rooted in the tradition of philosophy and science that began
  with Greek thinker Thales of Miletus who initiated a shift in thinking from
  mythos to logos with his theory that everything originates from water, and who
  according to tradition predicted a total solar eclipse that ended a war
  because everyone thought that the Gods were angry. "

        > ”Today, more than ever, when popularists are appealing to our baser
        emotions with distorted pictures of reality, we need to celebrate the
        ideals of science and philosophy and protect the free exchange of ideas
        in a calm and civil fashion. I welcome Thales Day as an occasion for
        remembering the importance of these ideas.” - Peter Singer

        “I applaud your endeavor to establish Thales Day on the calendar at a
        time when language is used more often for propaganda than as a medium
        for the pursuit of truth. 
           Stories, ritual, and celebrations are a way of communicating knowing and of sharing a common culture just as the sacrament of touch communicates love in a different way than words. However, Mythos is a story that bounds our knowledge and is haunted by its temptation to believe it to be objective fact; this belief enables the powerful to control and exploit a neighbor. Logos knowledge is derived from the process of dialogue with Nature, with Mythos, and with Adversary. Dialogue has no bounds; it allows continued testing and modification of belief in our quest for the discovery of truth and of reconciliation with all people.

        Yours Sincerely,


        John B. Goodenough”

    May 28, 585 BC is the day most commonly associated with the beginning of
    rational inquiry into nature. Therefore it is also relevant that we
    celebrate it just like we celebrate other important cultural landmarks with
    reference to the stories told about their origin, such as Christmas.


    If you have an idea on how to promote Thales Day we would love to hear from you. Let your creative juices run free and together we can develop the event further. Especially we are interested in hearing from people who might like to stage a Thales Day event in their city. Your corporation is essential to making Thales Day a beloved international event that can help strengthen societies ties to the tradition of philosophy and science.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
