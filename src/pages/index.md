    May 28, 585 BC is the day most commonly associated with the beginning of
    rational inquiry into nature. Therefore it is also relevant that we
    celebrate it just like we celebrate other important cultural landmarks with
    reference to the stories told about their origin, such as Christmas.


    If you have an idea on how to promote Thales Day we would love to hear from you. Let your creative juices run free and together we can develop the event further. Especially we are interested in hearing from people who might like to stage a Thales Day event in their city. Your cooperation is essential to making Thales Day a beloved international event that can help strengthen societies ties to the tradition of philosophy and science.
