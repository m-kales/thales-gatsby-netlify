title: Celebrate Critical Thinking
image: /img/nasa-hi5dx2obas-unsplash.jpg
description: May 28, 585 BC is the day most commonly associated with the
  beginning of rational inquiry into nature. Therefore it is also relevant that
  we celebrate it just like we celebrate other important cultural landmarks with
  reference to the stories told about their origin, such as Christmas.

testimonials:
  - author: Peter Singer
    quote: ”Today, more than ever, when popularists are appealing to our baser
      emotions with distorted pictures of reality, we need to celebrate the
      ideals of science and philosophy and protect the free exchange of ideas in
      a calm and civil fashion. I welcome Thales Day as an occasion for
      remembering the importance of these ideas.”
  - author: John B. Goodenough
    quote: “I applaud your endeavor to establish Thales Day on the calendar at a
      time when language is used more often for propaganda than as a medium for
      the pursuit of truth.     Stories, ritual, and celebrations are a way of
      communicating knowing and of sharing a common culture just as the
      sacrament of touch communicates love in a different way than words.
      However, Mythos is a story that bounds our knowledge and is haunted by its
      temptation to believe it to be objective fact; this belief enables the
      powerful to control and exploit a neighbor. Logos knowledge is derived
      from the process of dialogue with Nature, with Mythos, and with Adversary.
      Dialogue has no bounds; it allows continued testing and modification of
      belief in our quest for the discovery of truth and of reconciliation with
      all people.

    We are proud to have teamed up with highly esteemed animator Ib Kjeldsmark
    to offer you the first ever commercially available drawing of the famous
    story of Thales who fell into a well while watching the stars.

  text2:
    According to Plato a beautiful slave girl laughed at Thales and said, "You are so occupied with what is going on in the sky that you cannot see what is at your feet." Can you spot her in Kjeldsmark's original design?   

  text3:
    The story of Thales falling into a well went full circle when seemingly retold in a famous quote by the most famous scientist of the 21st century, Steven Hawking. He reminds us to, "Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious."

    The Thales Day logo was created by the brilliant graphical designer

    Mikael Hansen. It depicts the Eclipse of Thales and we think it fits

    really well on closing so that you can promote critical thinking and

    look sophisticated and stylish at the same time.


    What is remarkable about the Eclipse of Thales is not only that it

    puts a workable date on the beginning of the tradition of philosophy

    and science, but that both then and now predicting a total solar

    eclipse is likely the greatest symbol of the triumph of the kind of

    thinking that began with Thales and his contemporaries in ancient

    Greece.
