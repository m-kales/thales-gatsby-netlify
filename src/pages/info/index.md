description: May 28, 585 BC is the day most commonly associated with the
  beginning of rational inquiry into nature. Therefore it is also relevant that
  we celebrate it just like we celebrate other important cultural landmarks with
  reference to the stories told about their origin, such as Christmas.

testimonials:
  - author: Peter Singer
    quote: ”Today, more than ever, when popularists are appealing to our baser
      emotions with distorted pictures of reality, we need to celebrate the
      ideals of science and philosophy and protect the free exchange of ideas in
      a calm and civil fashion. I welcome Thales Day as an occasion for
      remembering the importance of these ideas.”
  - author: John B. Goodenough
    quote: “I applaud your endeavor to establish Thales Day on the calendar at a
      time when language is used more often for propaganda than as a medium for
      the pursuit of truth.     Stories, ritual, and celebrations are a way of
      communicating knowing and of sharing a common culture just as the
      sacrament of touch communicates love in a different way than words.
      However, Mythos is a story that bounds our knowledge and is haunted by its
      temptation to believe it to be objective fact; this belief enables the
      powerful to control and exploit a neighbor. Logos knowledge is derived
      from the process of dialogue with Nature, with Mythos, and with Adversary.
      Dialogue has no bounds; it allows continued testing and modification of
      belief in our quest for the discovery of truth and of reconciliation with
      all people.
